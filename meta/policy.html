  <h1>Privacy Policy for Languagizer</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: 17/10/2025</em></p>

  <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what data Languagizer ("the extension") collects and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Languagizer is designed to function entirely on your local machine.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Personal Data is Collected:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, browsing history, or user activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data you create, including custom alphabets and vault entries, is stored locally on your computer using your browser's storage APIs (<code>chrome.storage.sync</code> and <code>chrome.storage.local</code>). This data is never sent to any external server.</li>
    <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> The extension does not include any analytics or tracking scripts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Content Script</h2>
  <p>The extension uses a content script to detect and translate text within input fields on webpages you visit. This script runs locally in your browser and only processes text when you use the <code>!(...)</code> trigger. The content of the webpages is not read, stored, or transmitted.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
