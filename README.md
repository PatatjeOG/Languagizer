# 🌐 Languagizer

Languagizer is a fun and creative browser extension that lets you invent your own secret languages and alphabets. Create custom character mappings, save them to your personal vault, and then use them to automatically translate text on any webpage.

## ✨ Features

-   **Custom Alphabets**: Create and edit your own alphabets using text, symbols, and emoji.
-   **Language Vault**: Save, load, and manage your created languages in a local vault.
-   **Instant Translation**: Use the `!(your text)` syntax in any input field on any website to translate on the fly.
-   **Import/Export**: Easily share your creations by exporting single languages (`.lngz`) or your entire vault as a ZIP file.
-   **Decoder**: A simple tool to translate secret messages back into plain text.
-   **Privacy-Focused**: All your data is stored locally on your device. Nothing is ever sent to a server.

2.  Create a new language by mapping standard letters (a-z) to your desired characters.
3.  Save the language to your vault.
4.  On any website, type `!(your message)` into a text box.
